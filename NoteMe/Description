üß† Project Description:
I developed a Java-based Note-Taking Application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and search notes, with each note automatically timestamped for easy organization. The application stores all notes in individual ‚Äúnotebooks,‚Äù enabling quick retrieval and date-based searches.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in:
Java File I/O and Exception Handling
User Input Processing
Date & Time APIs in Java (java.time)
Menu-Driven Console Application Design

üîß Tools & Tech Used:
Java (Core + OOPs)
IntelliJ IDEA
Java I/O (FileReader, FileWriter, BufferedReader, etc.)
LocalDateTime & DateTimeFormatter

‚úÖ Project Highlights:
Console-based clean UI with menu navigation
Create and manage multiple notebooks
Search notes by keywords or date
Append or edit existing notes without overwriting previous entries
Automatic timestamps for each note
