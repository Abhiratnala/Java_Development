 ðŸ“Œ Project: Currency Converter using Java & Live API Integration
Iâ€™m thrilled to share my completed project for the Pinnacle Labs 2025 Java Development Internship!
ðŸ§  Project Description:
 I developed a Java-based Currency Converter that fetches real-time exchange rates using a REST API and converts between multiple international currencies. This project enhanced my understanding of:
Java I/O and Exception Handling
API Integration in Java
User Input Validation
Dynamic Currency Processing
ðŸ”§ Tools & Tech Used:
Java (Core + OOPs)
IntelliJ IDEA
REST API (ExchangeRate API)
âœ… Project Highlights:
Console-based clean UI
Supports major currencies (USD, INR, EUR, etc.)
Error handling for invalid inputs and API failures
